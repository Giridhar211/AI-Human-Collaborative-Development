## Title: AI-Human Collaborative Adapter Development Services

---

### Problem Statement:

Developers currently spend a significant amount of time reading user guides for individual IoT devices and developing services to interact with these devices based on the provided information. They need to integrate these services with Infer for two-way communication and monitoring using developed SDKs. The main objective of this AI-Human Collaborative Adapter Development Kit is to reduce development time by incorporating both AI and human intelligence.

---

### Solution:

We will develop a Generic Service that leverages AI to summarize user-defined documents and gathers human inputs on requirements from the summarization. This collaboration will then generate client code for communication with the IoT device server, streamlining the adapter development process.

---

### Tech Stack:

- Python
- ChatGPT / Similar LLM
- Infer Python SDK (Optional)

---

### Potential Use:

This solution could significantly reduce the burden on developers by automating the process of reading and understanding device documentation. It will also provide support to customers who wish to engage in adapter development by auto-summarizing information and generating necessary code through a collaborative approach.

---

### Implementation Plan:

1. **Document Summarization**: Use OpenAIâ€™s APIs or other open-source LLM models to create summaries of user-defined documents.
2. **Requirement Gathering**: Develop an interface for users to provide inputs based on the document summaries.
3. **Code Generation**: Use the gathered requirements to automatically generate client code for communication with IoT device servers.
4. **Human-AI Collaboration**: Implement a feedback loop where human intelligence fine-tunes the AI-generated code to ensure accuracy and efficiency.
5. **Testing and Deployment**: Conduct thorough testing to ensure the SDK works seamlessly with various IoT devices, followed by deployment.
